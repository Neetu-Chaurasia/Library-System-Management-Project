# Library-System-Management-Project
## Hello everyone!
## I'm Neetu Chaurasia, and this is my SQL project based on a Library Management System.

In this project, I’ve built a database-driven system that helps manage the day-to-day operations of a library. From tracking issued and returned books to calculating overdue fines, this system ensures smooth library operations. Using MySQL, I’ve implemented key features like member management, book inventory, and fine calculation.

Through SQL queries, I’ve extracted meaningful insights and built functionalities that simulate a real-world library environment.
